# perceptron
A single layer neural network for carrying out binary classifications.
This project was used to learn more about how neural networks work without using external libraries.
The inspiration for this project is included in the code file.
The unique elements of this project include making the project object-oriented, including user inputs, and increasing the classification efficiency by about 5%.
